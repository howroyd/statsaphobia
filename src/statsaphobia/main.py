    [yellow]This software requires two files to be present in the same directory:

    - A file named `password.txt` containing the password to decrypt the save file.
    - A file named `path.txt` containing the path to the save file; e.g.
        C:\Users\Simon\AppData\LocalLow\Kinetic Games\Phasmophobia\SaveFile.txt"
    [/]
    We will copy the save file to a backup directory and use the copy to decrypt and decode the save file.

    [red]At no point will we write to the games save file, we ONLY read it.
    No interrogation of the game is made.  No decompilation occurs.
    We only read the save file and decrypt it using the password you provide in `password.txt`.[/]
